###Surviving the June Spam Update: What to Do Next

Well, the June spam update hit my website this morning, and it feels like all the black hat pieces just fell on top. I lost rankings on all keywords. After gaining ground back after the core and HCU updates, it's disheartening to lose it again. Google search is truly like the armpits on a summer day with high humidity. This morning sucks.

**Here's what the community is saying:**

**u/fat-unicorn-cunt:**
"Same here. We were content leaders in our field (legal) until last Friday. Overnight, we lost 60-70% of our traffic to small law firms with thin content and poorly designed websites. We had top 3 local rankings for years, and now we're on pages 3-5. The SERPs are now mixed with small websites, big directories, and LinkedIn profiles. Our lost traffic has been shared among our competitors, and I can't find a reason. It sucks."

**u/jimmyflyer:**
"Sorry for your loss. Change URLs and 'Build Back Better!'"

**u/AhmedF:**
"We (Examine.com) also continue to go down. Sigh."

**u/Madlynik:**
"Don't worry. Verified SEO accounts will comment on how everything you did is wrong."

**u/Jinxedlad:**
"Endure the hairy armpit, like most others."

**u/TheRealDrNeko:**
"Stop relying on Google. Find more channels for your audience. Google is not reliable. The March update should have taught you not to trust Google at all. Try to play nice, and your competitors using blackhat methods will outrank you. SEO is never fair."

**u/Key-Tonight-6921:**
"Same here."

**Here's what you can do next:**

1. **Assess the Damage:** Use tools like Google Analytics and Search Console to see which pages lost traffic and rankings. Look for patterns.
   
2. **Review Google's Guidelines:** Ensure your site complies with Google's latest guidelines. Adjust as needed.

3. **Improve Content Quality:** Update your content to make it more valuable, informative, and engaging. Use multimedia elements to enhance user experience.

4. **Optimize Technical SEO:** Make sure your site is mobile-friendly, has a fast loading speed, and is free from technical errors.

5. **Build High-Quality Backlinks:** Focus on acquiring backlinks from reputable sites in your niche. Avoid blackhat techniques.

6. **Diversify Traffic Sources:** Don't rely solely on Google. Leverage social media, email marketing, content syndication, and paid advertising.

7. **Monitor and Adjust:** Continuously monitor your site's performance and make necessary adjustments. Stay updated with the latest SEO trends.

SEO can be a rollercoaster, but with the right strategies, you can recover and thrive. Hang in there, everyone!
